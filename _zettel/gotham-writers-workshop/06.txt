Think of a character. If that's too vague, make this character some kind of 
performer – actor, singer, magician – who has hit middle age and is finding
that his or her career is now mostly faded glory. Or use a parent or child who
is having difficulty with his or her own parent or child. Then think of a 
specific desire for this character. Onde driving desire. Make the desire 
something concrete – money, a career break, the touch of a certain person –
instead of an abstract desire like love or personal growth. Once you find the
character and desire, jot them down. We'll be coming back to this character
shortly.
